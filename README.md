Introduction 

Traffic management has become an important aspect for a cityâ€™s routine with exponential growth in the number of vehicles on road. The management of the traffic is an essential part for a city to work efficiently. Due to mismanagement of the traffic, the traffic jams take place wasting everyone's time.  This project aims to provide a solution to this problem with the help of computer vision concepts. We will be using the Indian driving dataset to test our model, which has multiple objects on the road with different sizes, shapes and colors. We will be utilizing the deep neural networks and YOLOv3 architecture to implement the models.
